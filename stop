`x` is the training dataset.
  `y` is the response variable.
  `kernel` is the Mercer kernel.
  `noise` is the noise variance, which also works as a regularization parameter.
  `normalize` is the option to normalize the response variable.
  `tol` is the stopping tolerance for HPO.
  `max-iter` is the maximum number of iterations for HPO. No HPO if maxIter <= 0."
